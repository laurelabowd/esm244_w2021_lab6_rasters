# Rasters

Rasters are discussed in this week's reading, found here: https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/spatial-class.html#raster-data.  For this lab, will just skim the surface.  There is also an EcoDataScience tutorial on rasters that goes into a bit more detail and provides some other methods of working with such data.  The repo for that tutorial is here: https://github.com/eco-data-science/eds_rasters

# The Data

## About the Landsat data

Here we're loading a raster saved as a GeoTIFF format.  This is probably the most common raster file type but there are others.  NetCDF is another format that is often seen with environmental and remote sensing data.

Data source: Landsat 7 ETM+, USGS, 2005 (borrowed from Frew)

Fun facts from the [Landsat 7 page at USGS.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/nli/landsat/landsat-7?qt-science_support_page_related_con=0#qt-science_support_page_related_con):

> Landsat 7 was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California on April 15, 1999 on a Delta II rocket. The satellite carries the Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) sensor.

> Landsat 7 carries the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensor, an improved version of the Thematic Mapper instruments that were onboard Landsat 4 and Landsat 5. Landsat 7 products are delivered as 8-bit images with 256 grey levels. Descriptions of Landsat 7 band designations and comparisons of all Landsat sensors are available.  

> Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+):  

> * Eight spectral bands, including a pan and thermal band:
>   * Band 1 Visible (0.45 - 0.52 µm) 30 m
>   * Band 2 Visible (0.52 - 0.60 µm) 30 m
>   * Band 3 Visible (0.63 - 0.69 µm) 30 m
>   * Band 4 Near-Infrared (0.77 - 0.90 µm) 30 m
>   * Band 5 Short-wave Infrared (1.55 - 1.75 µm) 30 m
>   * Band 6 Thermal (10.40 - 12.50 µm) 60 m Low Gain / High Gain
>   * Band 7 Mid-Infrared (2.08 - 2.35 µm) 30 m
>   * Band 8 Panchromatic (PAN) (0.52 - 0.90 µm) 15 m
> * Ground Sampling Interval (pixel size): 30 m reflective, 60 m thermal

We'll come back to some of this info later.  Especially note Band 3 and Band 4...

## Loading and inspecting the data

Let's try loading the Landsat raster and see what it looks like.  The `raster()` function reads in a single raster layer:

```{r}
landsat_file <- here('data/Landsat7.tif')

ls_1 <- raster(landsat_file)
ls_1
                     
      
```
Things to note:

* `band: 1 (of 5 bands)`: we'll come back to this later!
* `dimensions`: this is how many cells in x, in y, and overall
* `resolution`: each cell represents an area of 30 x 30 in the current CRS (the metadata above tells us 30 m)
* `extent`: what are the corners of the map, in the current CRS
* `crs`: Coordinate Reference System.  `+proj=aea` is projection type (Albers Equal Area); the other parameters tell where on the globe we're looking.  Note `+units=m` - this tells us our units for the above numbers are in meters (per the metadata).
* `values`: the cells contain values as low as 0 and as high as 255.

We can also quickly plot it using base `plot` function - we'll use `ggplot` later on.

```{r}
plot(ls_1)
```

```{r}
ls_2 <- raster(landsat_file, band = 2)
ls_3 <- raster(landsat_file, band = 3)
ls_4 <- raster(landsat_file, band = 4)

# Reading in individual layers, or you could have read them all in as a brick

ls_stack <- raster::stack(landsat_file)
ls_stack



```

## Preparing the data
Grouping the data so that it is easier to work with b/c we don't really care about resolution for this

```{r}
# Update original layers by grouping 3 x 3 cells into one cell using the mean (overwriting created problems)
ls_1_mean <- raster::aggregate(ls_1, fact = 3, fun = mean)
ls_2_mean <- raster::aggregate(ls_2, fact = 3, fun = mean)
ls_3_mean <- raster::aggregate(ls_3, fact = 3, fun = mean)
ls_4_mean <- raster::aggregate(ls_4, fact = 3, fun = mean)

plot(ls_1_mean, col = hcl.colors(n = 100, palette = "Blues 2"))
plot(ls_2_mean, col = hcl.colors(n = 100, palette = "Greens 2"))
plot(ls_3_mean, col = hcl.colors(n = 100, palette = "Reds 2"))
plot(ls_4_mean, col = hcl.colors(n = 100, palette = "Reds 2"))

```
ote how the patterns change a bit from layer to layer.  These different bands represent different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.  Band 1 is blues, band 2 is greens, band 3 is reds, band 4 is near infrared.

### `raster::mask()`

We can also use another layer (either raster or vector) to "mask" our current layer - dropping any cells in the current layer that match up with `NA` in the mask layer.

```{r}
sbc_rast <- raster(here('data/county.tif'))
plot(sbc_rast)
plot(ls_3_mean)
mask(ls_3_mean, sbc_rast) %>% plot() # got rid of ocean

# Just working with ls_3 and ls_4 from here on out
ls_3_mean <- mask(ls_3_mean, sbc_rast)
ls_4_mean <- mask(ls_4_mean, sbc_rast)

```

# Working with rasters

## Raster algebra 

```{r}
# Working with rasters is just like working with big vectors -> can do algebra
vec1 <- 1:5
vec1 *2 

ls_3_mean
ls_3_mean * 2
log(ls_3_mean)
plot(ls_3_mean); plot(log(ls_3_mean))
```

```{r}
vec2 <- 6:10
vec1 + vec2

ls_3_mean + ls_4_mean
```

## `raster::calc()`

The `raster::calc()` function allows you to use other functions on single rasters (`RasterLayer` objects) or multiple rasters (`RasterStack` or `RasterBrick` objects).  You can also include `na.rm = TRUE` as an argument (assuming the math function recognizes it). Often the raster algebra notation is easier, but for complex formulas on large datasets, calc is probably faster, and includes a `filename` argument in case you wish to write the result directly to a file. 

```{r}
# Create another stack
ls_stack_2 <- stack(ls_1_mean, ls_2_mean, ls_3_mean, ls_4_mean)
ls_mean <- raster::calc(ls_stack, fun = mean, na.rm = FALSE)

plot(ls_mean) # Hmm didn't get rid of ocean for me w/ na.rm = FALSE

```
# Analysis

## NDVI

NDVI, or Normalized Differential Vegetation Index, is a common method of using satellite imagery to detect vegetation cover.  Sunlight reflected from the surface includes red, green, and blue portions of the spectrum, as well as infrared.  Just looking at "green" will also include the green components of whites, greys, yellows, browns, etc.  So instead, NDVI takes advantage of a cool fact about how chlorophyll works: it absorbs blues and reds, but reflects greens and near infrared.

![](img/spectrum.png)

(img from [bioninja](https://ib.bioninja.com.au/standard-level/topic-2-molecular-biology/29-photosynthesis/action-spectrum.html))

![](img/ir_photo.jpg)

The formula looks like this:
$$NDVI = \frac{NIR - Red}{NIR + Red}$$
Values can range from -1 to 1; usually a score of greater than ~0.2-0.3 is used to denote forest canopy.  Negative values are generally related to clouds or snow fields.

## Calculate NDVI

Using raster algebra, let's calculate NDVI for the county:

```{r}
ndvi <- (ls_4_mean - ls_3_mean) / (ls_4_mean + ls_4_mean)

plot(ndvi, col = hcl.colors(100, 'Grays'))

is_forest <- function(x, thresh = .3) {
  y <- ifelse(x >= thresh, 1, NA)
  return(y)
}

forest <- calc(ndvi, fun = is_forest)
plot(forest, col = 'green')
```
# `ggplot()` and rasters

`ggplot` likes dataframes - not rasters - so we have to convert our raster to a dataframe.  The `raster::rasterToPoints()` function converts a raster to a matrix of points - `x`, `y`, and `layer` (or the layer name if it's a named layer).  Then `as.data.frame()` can convert that matrix to a `data.frame` object suitable for `ggplot.`

Note: `ggplot` is a little slow with large-ish rasters - the `raster::plot()` function that we used earlier is better optimized but just trickier to make look good, especially if you're used to the features of `ggplot`.

## plot NDVI and forest cover

```{r}
ndvi_df <- raster::rasterToPoints(ndvi) %>% 
  as.data.frame()

forest_df <- raster::rasterToPoints(forest) %>% 
  as.data.frame()

ggplot(data = ndvi_df, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = layer)) +
  geom_raster() +
  geom_raster(data = forest_df, fill = 'green') +
  coord_sf(expand = 0) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = 'black', high = 'white') +
  theme_void() +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "slateblue4"))
```
# Going further

Would this NDVI approach also work for other layer combos based on differences in absorption/reflectance? e.g., red-green, blue-green, blue-IR?  You have the technology - try it out and compare your results to the "official" NDVI calculation results, and post what you find on Slack #code-wins!
